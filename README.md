Installation
------------
With [composer](http://packagist.org), add:

```bash
$ composer require laulamanapps/ecurring-api
```
This package has been created with flexability in mind, you can simply implement your own http adapter by implementing the `LauLamanApps\eCurring\Http\ClientInterface`

Don't wanna do the hassle? make use of the provided Guzzle adapter: require guzzlehttp in your composer:

```bash
$ composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
```
